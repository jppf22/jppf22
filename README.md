- Hi my username is jppf22 and I'm an aspiring portuguese computer science student.
- I'm willing to collaborate on projects, if I know what the proposed one entails (wouldn't bet on it since I'm still learning).
- My interests right now are machine learning, data structures and embedded systems.
- If you've got any useful tips I'm all ears.
